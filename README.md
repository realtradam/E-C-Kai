## Game Design Document

Here we should write ideas and stuff we want to implement. Should add some drawings, pictures, and stuff. This will help when working on this project asyncroniously to kinda code in the same direction.  
This document isnt supposed to be a strict thing to follow but instead something that evolves overtime as we get new ideas and change old ones.
